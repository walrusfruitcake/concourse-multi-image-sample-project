# concourse-multi-image-sample-project

This repo is for driving out whatever image solution concourse-multi-image winds up using to support combinations of dependencies to work around docker image single-inheritance.

Rephrased: this repo is for a dummy app that needs dependencies beyond those provided by a single officially-maintained docker image on Docker Hub.
